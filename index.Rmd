# Objective 

The objectives of this lab are:

  - To familiarize you with the power semiconductors we will use in the class.
  - Learn the use of LTSPICE using libraries provided by device manufacturers and simulate conditions to compare with device datasheets.
  - Experimentally measure the V-I curves of various power semiconductors.
  - Write simplified LTSPICE simulation models to be used throughout the course.
